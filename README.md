# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Using my knowledge of PySpark I had to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. For this analysis, 
I needed to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Results:

-How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? The total number of reviews were 31,830.

-How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? The number of 5 star reviews were 14,777.
